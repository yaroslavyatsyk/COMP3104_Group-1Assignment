This course is designed to better prepare professionals entering the IT field. 
Specifically, a field where servers, web apps and infrastructure will be core to 
business needs. COMP 3104 will provide a hands-on experience through the 
implementation of tried, tested and true DevOps technologies. 
We will also examine ways in which companies have either lost or saved fortunes 
with DevOps strategies. Learning about Amazon Web Services, Ansible, Docker and 
Travis CI, you will become familiar with end-to-end deployment processes. You will 
also have your very own build pipeline which will allow you to push changes to a 
web app in the wild at the stroke of a key.
Using DevOps practices effectively will allow for a process predicated on ease to 
ship code to Production servers, apply hot-fixes, catch errors before they produce 
some sort of unintended behavior and keep transparency & communication 
heightened across all teams. Looking at the software development lifecycle 
through the lens of a DevOps Engineer will produce a more informed and qualified 
developer.
